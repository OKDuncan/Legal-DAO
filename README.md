# Legal-DAO
Creating open source legal frameworks for crafting various decentralized cryptocurrency organizations.

DAOs formed as the first application of the Ethereum network that gathered a widespread and passionate mindshare across the ecosystem. When the original DAO rose in 2016, it was the largest ICO in the ecosystem. That senitment has not died, token projects like DAOStack and Aragon raised ~30 million in their ICOs, Colony has self funded development for years to create effective resource management within teams, and recently MolochDAO memed itself into existence (off the broken codebase of the original DAO)... in conlusion, DAOs are back.

The original DAO aimed to be a decentralized VC and was found by the SEC to have broken (securities law)[https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-131].
